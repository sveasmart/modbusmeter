# This is the default configuration for Meter.
# Override it by creating a local.yml next to it.
# The config isn't hot-reloaded, so you need to restart

# The name used to identify this meter when talking to the backend
# If not set, a QR code will be displayed pointing to registrationBaseUrl
meterName: "Unregistered"

# Optionally, a second meterName be set if this device has two meters.
meterName2:

# The URL of the backend to which ticks are posted
serverUrl: "http://localhost:3000/energynotification"

# How long we are willing to wait for a response from serverUrl,
# before considering it a failure and starting the retry loop.
# This needs to be pretty big, for those cases where a meter has been offline
# for weeks and then suddenly goes online and wants to send a notification with thousands of events.
# For example, in one case meter send a notification with 36,000 events, and it took 74 seconds to get a response
# from the server.
serverTimeoutSeconds: "300"

# The URL that will be used in the QR code that is displayed when no meterName is set.
# The deviceId will be passed along using an # (anchor tag).
# Example: http://my.server/register#abcdefgh

# Which file contains the device ID
deviceIdPath: "./test/device-id"

# If simulate is 0, then no ticks are simulated.
# If > 0, then a fake tick is sent every X seconds
simulate: "0"

# Same as simulate, but for the second meter (meterName2)
# if have one.
simulate2: "0"

# Minimum number of seconds between each send.
# Higher number means fewer http requests and more energy events per batch.
# Must be at least 1 second.
notificationInterval: "10"

# Limit the number of events per notification.
# If more events than this have been buffered up,
# they will be split into separate notifications.
# Otherwise we risk server timeouts because of the large number of
# database updates happening on the server side.
maxEventsPerNotification: "1000"

# How many seconds of pulses each energy event should include
eventInterval: "10"

# How much energy (in Wh) does one pulse represent?
energyPerPulse: "1"

# If true, pulses are logged in console.log
# Should be a string, so don't skip the quotes.
logPulseDetection: "true"

# If true, logs stuff that happens over and over again
# Should be a string, so don't skip the quotes.
verboseLogging: "true"

# The folder that contains batched and sent ticks.
dataDir: "data"

# Which pin the ticks are reported through (pin number, not GPIO number)
tickInputPin: "12"

# If meterName2 is configured, you also need a tickInputPin2
tickInputPin2: "16"

# Which port the display RPC server is listening on.
# https://github.com/sveasmart/display
# ... or leave it blank if we should just use console.log instead of trying to talk to a display
